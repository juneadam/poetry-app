Poetry Toolkit is an app for people who like poems. The goal is to inspire users to read more and write more by making accessible and approachable tools for English-language poets.

Using the [PoetryDB](https://poetrydb.org/index.html) API, as well as our built-in database, users can view centuries of poetry and search for authors or titles they like. They can also respond to poetry prompts or create their own to inspire other users. Users can also create poem mashups by randomly mixing and matching lines from existing works. Users can save their prompt responses and their favorite mashups to their profile and choose to share them with other users.

## Tech Stack:
- Python, Flask, Jinja 
- Javascript (AJAX, React), CSS, HTML, Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- PoetryDB API
