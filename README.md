# Poetry Toolkit

**deployment coming soon!**

**Demo Video:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6cDlsd1Lxk)

Poetry Toolkit is an app for people who like poems. The goal is to inspire users to read more and write more by making accessible and approachable tools for English-language poets.

Using the [PoetryDB](https://poetrydb.org/index.html) API, as well as our built-in database, users can view centuries of poetry and search for authors or titles they like. They can also respond to poetry prompts or create their own to inspire other users. Users can also create poem mashups by randomly mixing and matching lines from existing works. Users can save their prompt responses and their favorite mashups to their profile and choose to share them with other users.

## Tech Stack:
- Python, Flask, Jinja 
- Javascript (AJAX, React), CSS, HTML, Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- PoetryDB API

# Development Diary:

### Day 1, 12/18/22: Brainstorming project ideas:
- music-related:
    - basic synthesizer:
        - produce soundwaves
        - alter pitch
        - change filter/effects
        - learn about basic synthesizer functionality
        - basic FL type daw:
        - 4-8 channels
        - 4 melody/bass
        - 4 percussion
        - looping
        - adjust BPM
        - adjust time signature
        - GUI to enter in beats on a grid
        - just drums? melody interface different?
- poetry-related
    - prompt-generator:
        - user inputs that affect outcome
        - questions?
    - writing collaboration platform:
        - connect users with creative ways to limit/inspire collaboration (not just a blank page)
        - would require messaging/internet functionality
    - line-break machine:
        - fucks up your lines for you to make your poems better!
        might be too simple of a project?
- other:
    - game of some sort
        - more brainstorming needed

### Day 2 12/20/22 - discussing with Trew, advising #1:
- poetry APIs exist
- web sockets are challenging
- search feature - key word, database building (to store poetry)
- multiple users working on the same doc
- will I be excited for 4 weeks straight? something joyful
- save presets for synthesizer
- private/public database options, searchable presets
- include React in project (might increase hireability)

### Day 3 1/5/23
- lol i never wrote anything on this day, why didn‚Äôt I delete this header? ü§∑ (2/19/2023)

### Day 4 1/10/23
- MVP outlines:
	- Synthesizer MVP:
        - user log in
        - simple inputs to modify sound (tone.js framework)
        - be able to save settings to database and load / share
        - randomized settings for inspiration
	- Nice to haves:
        - more robust input/sequencing options
        - multi-user collaboration
        - public/private database to search for presets
        - dynamic mapping of users?
	- Poetry MVP:
        - poetryDB framework
        - prompt-generator
        - line-break machine (enter poetry, returns new line breaks)
        - use poetryDB to generate poems for inspiration
	- Nice to haves:
        - user inputs to affect prompt-generator
        - database to store/share poetry
        - collaboration tools for multiple users
        - dynamic mapping of users?
	- Bonus:
		- for any project, nice to have:
            - avatar generation/customization via classes
            - unlock upgrades by interacting somehow?
            - stock images - sprout to flower, based on number of interactions?

            - data visualization of lyrics
            - break down poems by particular words and phrases, dynamic mapping

### Day 5 1/17/2023
Visualized poetry/synth sites as flow charts

Every day, try to make a note:
What did you struggle with?
Did you figure something out?
Did you fail to figure something out?
Did you make hard trade-offs?
What did you study?
What did you learn?
How do you work?
What do you need?

## Actual Project Time:
### Day 6 1/30/2022:
- Was sick last week so didn‚Äôt keep this diary

### Day 7 1/31/2023:
Commits today:
- ‚Äúwe can now load user comments and saved poems, as well as user responses and saved prompts, on new savedpoems / savedprompts templates‚Äù 5:15PM
    - sending poem/prompt id via post request from submit buttons that display this id # on the user profile - feels like there must be a better way to handle this, or at least mask the id # (maybe this can be resolved via React when/if I get to that?
- "you can now edit and save edits to the database for responses and comments by opening them from the user profile" 8:52PM
    - Trew helped me solve the previous problem using ```<input type=‚Äùhidden‚Äù>```
    - next steps for tomorrow is to investigate how to implement user profile using React
### Day 8 2/1/2023:
- "userprofiletest route to assess building user profile with React was successful" ~7:30PM (commited 11AM 2/2)
    - successfully recreated the userprofile page using react, links appear to be populating and work as expected (identical to previous version)
    - i think this will be useful for styling and good practice for wrapping my head around React - will have to think if there are any other useful and more dynamic ways to implement React into the app
### Day 9 2/2/2023:
- added search functionality for author, title, and line count (5:45 PM)
- mashup route is working, need to adddd more functionality for title and author (8:15 PM)
### Day 10 2/3/2023:
- added keyword search for lines/body on poem page (2:10 PM)
- "added title and author generation for mashups, tweaked value input to number, added easter eggs for poems of certain line lengths" (3:34PM)
- ‚Äúphew got mashups to saved to the database and they now load on the userprofiletest jsx page as well!‚Äù (7:06 PM)
### Day 11 2/4/2023:
- rerouted user profile to the React version (12:38 PM)
### Day 12 2/6/2023:
- ‚Äúadded checkboxes to u user profile for updating public status of prompts/mashups (non-functional)‚Äù (6:06) PM
   - these are ‚Äúread-only‚Äù because of the way React renders things - need to research out to get these to work and build routes for updating each
- ‚Äúworking template for viewing saved mashups‚Äù (6:48 PM)
   - no JS at this time
- ‚Äútweaked display for userprofile (links changed to text, button text updated)‚Äù (7:07 PM)
   - minor display tweaks
- ‚Äúadded bootstrap accordion to prompt responses on user page, not sure if this is totally feasible with the way boostrap appears to be structured here‚Äù (7:42 PM)
   - bootstrap appears to have pre-structured names such as ‚ÄúcollapseOne‚Äù ‚ÄúcollapseTwo‚Äù etc. it‚Äôs unclear if/how I can get the for loop for the .jsx file to render this correctly, otherwise all accordions response to all interactions
### Day 13 2/7/2023:
- "added bootstrap accordion to just the headers in the user profile template, will have to remove them from the jsx - this is more appropriate for now" (1:45 PM)

### Day 14 2/8/2023:

### Day 16 2/10/2023:
- mashup and prompt cards are now matching - DOMException error for querySelector for the update button IDs needs to be addressed (11:41 AM)

- "update public/private functionality on user profile is now working" (2:47 PM)
    - bug where the checkmarks for mashups appear to default to true even when boolean is false in the database (correctly not showing up in public mashup list) - this is not happening in the prompts section
- ‚Äúadded routing and templates for deactivating a user account and reactivating it with successful login‚Äù (6:59 PM)
### Day 17 2/11/2023:

- "sorted out the styling so that user profile cards, public mashup cards, and public prompts cards now appear in responsive rows. also added page-header styling" (2:52 PM)
